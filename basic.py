#lists in python are zero-indexed = meaning the first item in them sits at position 0
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

my_list[0]

#will print 'a'

my_list[2]

#will print 'c'

#tuples are a type of list that can't be changed once created
tuple_of_numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

#dictionaries are a datatype that stores keys and values as '':''

#control structures will let us execute code when the right conditions are met
#2 types of control structures we'll use = if statements and 
#if statements:
number = 20
if number > 10 #declare the if condition
  print "thats a big number!"
#this should pring "thats a big number!"

#in if statements we'll use equality operators (greater than(>), less than (<), and greater than or equal to (>=),
#and equal to (==), this is a double equals sign because a single equals sign (=), is an assignment operator.)
